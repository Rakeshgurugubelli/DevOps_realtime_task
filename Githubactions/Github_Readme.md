**why we use github instead of jenkins ?**

In jenkins we will install jenkins in master and attached slaves servers to run the jobs

But in Github we have runners(similar to slave)

**shared runners:** Shared runners we can run the jobs it is completey free, but we cant have access to the backend.

                Ex: if we want to run any commands we need to write ubuntu_latest

**private runners:**  Here we can bring our own virtual machine and add this as a runner, it is complete isolated

          
**Setup**
