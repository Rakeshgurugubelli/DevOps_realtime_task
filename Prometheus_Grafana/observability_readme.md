1.) what is observability?

Ans.) if we have observability setup we can get the information of internal state system (app+infra+network)
      we can get the information of disk utilization of particular pod
      we can get the information cpu utilization of yhe node
      memory utilization
      we can get http requests success or failure
2.) why is observability?

Ans.) By using observability we can find the failures and also helps to fix it 

3.) what is metrics?

Ans.) Metrics basically gives historical data of event
      event means: cpu,memory,disk,http requests

4.) what is logs?

Ans.) it will helps to understand application better
      different logs: info log,debug log, error logs, trace log

5.) what is traces?

Ans.) by using traces we can troubleshoot, fixing theissues

ðŸ”„ Scraping Workflow

  . Prometheus periodically scrapes endpoints (e.g., /metrics) exposed by exporters.

  . It stores the collected metrics in its TSDB (time series database).

  . Prometheus can trigger alerts based on alert rules.

  . Dashboards in Grafana pull data using PromQL to visualize metrics.


**Grafana:**

-> it is open source tool for performing data analytics retrieving metrics that make of large amount of data and monitoring our apps using nice configurable dashboard.

-> so grafana can integrate with a wide range of data sources including graphite,prometheus influx TB elastic search mysql postgres and others.

-> so when connected to supported data sources it will provide web based chart graphs and alert

**promethus**

-> it is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability in model and dynamic environment.

-> which prometheus is excels at collecting and storing time series data allowing users to gain valuable insight into the performance and health of the application and infrastruture 

-> so its powerful query language and support for multi-dimensional data prometheus has become a popular choice for monitoring system with cloud native
