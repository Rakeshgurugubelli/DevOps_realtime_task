**Authentication:** In Kubernetes, authentication validates the identity of a user or service account making a request to the API server.

Example: When you run kubectl, Kubernetes checks your credentials (like tokens or certificates) to verify your identity.

**Authorization** After authentication, Kubernetes checks if the user is authorized to perform the requested operation (like reading a pod or deleting a service).

Example: Even if your identity is verified, Kubernetes will deny access if you don‚Äôt have permission to delete a deployment.

**üìÅ RBAC resources:**

**Role:** defines permissions within a namespace.

**ClusterRole:** defines permissions cluster-wide.

**RoleBinding:** applies a Role to a user/group in a namespace.

**ClusterRoleBinding:** applies a ClusterRole across the whole cluster.

**ü§ñ What is a Service Account in Kubernetes?**

A Service Account is an identity used by pods (applications) to interact with the Kubernetes API.

Just like users need permission to access resources, service accounts do too ‚Äî and that's where RBAC roles and permissions come in.

**Below steps are implementing the cluster and role binding**

**Step-1:** Create a user & setup  password

command:  
        
         useradd rakesh 
         
         passwd rakesh

**Step2:** Add admin access to the user(by using below command we can do admin access)

command:

        usermod -aG sudo rakesh

**Step-3:** Create a directory in the tmp folder or any folder based on requirement and go inside the folder

command:

        mkdir /tmp/rbac

 **Step-4,5,6 is not required when we working eks directly go to step-7 if we are working with eks**

**step-4:** Create a key for the user 

command:

       openssl genrsa -out rakesh.key 2048

**Step-5:** After create key need to create the certificate signing key
       
command:

          openssl req -new -key rakesh.key -out rakesh.csr -subj "/CN=rakesh/O=devops"

**Step-6:** Create the certificate key using the user key and certificate signing key

command:

        openssl x509 -req -in rakesh.csr - CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out rakesh.crt -days 365

**Step-7:** Run  the below to edit configmap

command: 

        kubectl get configmap aws-auth -n kube-system -o yaml
